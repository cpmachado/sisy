# sisy (WIP)

The tool for Task Driven Depression (TDD) is `sisy`. It's a simple To-Do tool
that will integrate jokes to make your day a bit lighter on your shoulders,
as you drive to push the boulder up the mountain.

As Albert Camus might have said, in a chiller way:

> Don't be a sissy, be like Sisyphus, and imagine him happy.
>
> -- Albert Camus(Highly adapted, and paraphrased)
